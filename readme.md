# FileMaker Data API v1 Postman Collection

This is a Postman collection for the [FileMaker Data API for FileMaker 18](https://fmhelp.filemaker.com/docs/18/en/dataapi/) and [Claris OData API and FileMaker OData API Guide](https://help.claris.com/en/odata-guide/content/write-odata-api-calls.html).

This is not a collection I created. I found it on the during my development process and wanted to make it available here. Unfortunately, I don't know who created it. If you know, please let me know and I'll update this readme. It was helpful to me and I didn't want it to disappear.

## Usage

1. Download the collection from this repo.
2. Import the collection to Postman
3. Create a new environment in Postman and start testing your API calls.

## Notes

This repo accompanies a post I wrote on my blog, [Learning the FileMaker Data API by trial and error](https://supergeekery.com/blog/learning-the-filemaker-data-api-by-trial-and-error). In the post, I talk about how I used this collection to learn the Data API. How I dealt with CORS errors using a PHP proxy, and how I used the proxy to query the FileMaker API from my Javascript app.
